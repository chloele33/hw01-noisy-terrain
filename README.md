Adjustable sea level and mountain count to have sparse/dense land vs. water in the scene.

## Implementation

A few noise functions were used in the production of this project, including 2D FBM, 3D FBM, and Worley Noise. 

To create the mountain ranges, 2D FBM, Worley noise, and a redistribution of noise were used. 
I first combined fbm and worley noises together, and then a redistribution of the height was used to bias the mountain ranges to have sharper creases and peaks.

The coloring of this terrain combines height with 3D FBM, and it colors the terrain based on the height of each point. For some range of heights, a mixture of two colors was used to create a grainy fade out/fade in effect.
